# Overview

This code is written in c++ and involves a  games for the user to play! SO far we have hangman to be played. I wanted to create games because I think they do a good job showing different parts of C++ and they are fun. C++ is a great tool for creating games because of its performance and control.

When running the hangman file in the terminal you want to do the following: 
```bash
g++ Hangman.cpp
```
And then run: 
```bash
./a.out
```
This will the initiate the game in the terminal where you can guess letters to try and get the word!

I chose to do Hangman because of the different tools you can use in c++ to create a game like hangman. One of the things I found to be useful was that you can define a variable by char which means character. This was handy when creating hangnamn because the user guesses charaters at a time to guess the overall word. Something else nice about c++ when creating a game like hangman was how easy it is to create new functions that can be used within the program. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Something I would want to add in the future is more games to this collection. I think hangman was a really fun start and it would be fun to code other games. Almost like a github repo for arcade games!
